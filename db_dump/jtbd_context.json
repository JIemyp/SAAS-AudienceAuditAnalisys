Energy optimization job depends on: baseline tracking system already in place (Whoop/Oura), consistent routine to isolate variables, clear start/end markers. Inflammation reduction job depends on: recent bloodwork baseline, willingness to wait 3 months for next labs, other variables controlled (diet, exercise stable). Social jobs depend on: functional jobs succeeding first, must have data to share, community receptive to the product. Emotional 'control' job depends on: transparent company data, clear mechanism of action, ability to track daily, no black-box solutions. Money-saving job depends on: clear ROI calculation framework, comparison vs current stack cost, refund policy safety net. Sequence: First establish baseline data → trial intervention → measure at 30/60/90 days → if positive, continue and share socially → if negative, refund and try next solution.","approved_at":"2025-12-11T00:44:46.739914+00:00"},
